    Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. We'll put a happy little bush here. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.

    <p>Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Look at them little rascals. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Those great big fluffy clouds. Anything you want to do you can do here. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Isn't that fantastic? I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Everybody needs a friend. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. It's all a game of angles. Let's get wild today. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>

<p>It's important to me that you're happy. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. A fan brush can be your best friend. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. All kinds of happy little splashes. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Just make a decision and let it go. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Every day I learn. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.</p>

<p>You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. It takes dark in order to show light. Zip. That easy. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here.</p>

<p>If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Imagination is the key to painting. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Let's get crazy. What the devil. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Poor old tree. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.</p>

<p>Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Now then, let's play. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Let's do that again. Learn when to stop. Get tough with it, get strong.</p>

<p>The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. See there how easy that is. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can do anything your heart can imagine. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. This is a fantastic little painting. There we go. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. You can spend all day playing with mountains. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Here's something that's fun.</p>

<p>I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We'll make some happy little bushes here. It is a lot of fun. Use your imagination, let it go. Don't fight it, use what happens. Just beat the devil out of it. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>

<p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We'll put a happy little bush here. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It all happens automatically. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.</p>

<p>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Let your imagination be your guide. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Let's make a happy little mountain now. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. This painting comes right out of your heart. You're meant to have fun in life. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>

<p>Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Just let these leaves jump off the brush Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Anyone can paint. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let's build an almighty mountain. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Little short strokes. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>

<p>We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. In life you need colors. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Have fun with it. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.</p>

<p>All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. This piece of canvas is your world. And maybe, maybe, maybe... If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Let the paint work. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. You need the dark in order to show the light. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. This is unplanned it really just happens. Let's do it again then, what the heck.</p>

<p>Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Don't be bashful drop me a line. I like to beat the brush. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. You have to make these big decisions. Let that brush dance around there and play. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Take your time. Speed will come later. With practice comes confidence. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Here's another little happy bush You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. This is truly an almighty mountain. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. You can do it. All those little son of a guns. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Every time you practice, you learn more. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.</p>

    <p>I like to beat the brush. There we are. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.</p>

<p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. A fan brush can be your best friend.</p>

<p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We have a fantastic little sky! Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

<p>Fluff that up. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Every day I learn.</p>

<p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Every time you practice, you learn more. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>

<p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Just beat the devil out of it. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>

<p>Brown is such a nice color. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. It all happens automatically. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.</p>

<p>That's crazy. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun</p>

<p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. The least little bit can do so much. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. In this world, everything can be happy. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</p>

<p>If you hypnotize it, it will go away. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>

<p>Everybody needs a friend. Do an almighty painting with us. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. At home you have unlimited time.</p>

<p>Have fun with it. Just a little indication. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. A happy cloud. Be brave.</p>

<p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>
